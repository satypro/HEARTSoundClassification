\section*{Introduction}
The Project Plan document basically defines the tasks and scope of the project against a timeline. It can also showcase the different milestone achievements and deadlines for each of them.

\section*{Problem Statement}
The Human heart generates a lub dub sound under its normal operating conditions. But it give rises to many variations of the normal sounds when recorded from unhealthy subjects. Hence with an increase in the number of smart devices capable of listening to heart sounds, there is a need to conceptualize and prototype algorithms capable of automatically detecting normal v/s abnormal heart sounds.
